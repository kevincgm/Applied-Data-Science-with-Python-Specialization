# Introduction to Data Science in Python
The course is conducted by the University of Michigan on coursera and is the 1st of the series 'Applied Data Science with Python Specialization'.

This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 

The course is split into 4 weeks of learning and each week is concluded with a lab assignment and a graded quiz.

Week 1: Fundamentals of Data Manipulation with Python
Week 2: Basic Data Processing with Python
Week 3: More Data Processing with Python
Week 4: Answering Questions with Messy Data
