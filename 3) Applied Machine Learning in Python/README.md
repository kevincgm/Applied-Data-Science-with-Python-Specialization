# Applied-Machine-Learning-in-Python

This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. 

The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). 

The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis. 

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Week 1: 
Understand basic machine learning concepts and workflow
Distinguish between different types of machine learning tasks, based on examples of how they are applied to real-world problems
Understand how a basic classification algorithm (k-nearest neighbors) learns and makes predictions
Build and evaluate a basic k-nearest neighbors classifier on an example dataset using Python and scikit-learn

Week 2: 
Understand how different supervised learning algorithms - in particular, those based on linear models - estimate their own parameters from data to make new predictions.
Understand the strengths and weaknesses of particular supervised learning methods in order to apply the right algorithm for a given task.
Apply specific supervised machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.
Recognize general principles of supervised machine learning that are common across algorithms, such as the connection between model complexity and generalization performance.
Apply techniques like regularization, feature scaling, and cross-validation to avoid common pitfalls like under- and overfitting.

Week 3: 
Understand why accuracy alone can be an inadequate metric for getting a more complete picture of a classifier's performance
